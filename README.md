This is [my entry](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=51748) for Ludum Dare 35, created in 48 hours over the weekend of 16–17 april 2016.

The game is an endless cave exploration game, where the player is an orb that can change size and mass in an instant. Use this ability to get as deep into the cave as you can without getting blown to pieces by inconveniently placed dynamite of falling off a sudden cliff. 

## How to play

Use the arrow keys to move around. Hold space to gain mass. The player is much harder to control when it's larger, but won't fall down holes as easy. You can take three hits from dynamite, but falling into an abyss will kill you instantly.
